# Project Description
Recype is a handy recipy finder to help you figure out what you want to cook.

# Project 03 Extension
Phase 3 was extended in several ways.
1. The project structure was made much more cohesive.
2. Webpack was integrated so dependencies and imports can be more easily managed.
3. A basic implementation of edamame api was added for recipy searching.
4. Bootstrap was implemented for visuals.
